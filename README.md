# Credit Card Fraud detection with Classifiers

## Background
Most of my recent ML projects had been using regression algorithms.  As such I wanted a mini project to work on that would help me to practice my my use of classifers and refreshing my understanding of evaluating performance of classifiers.  In particular, I wanted to improve my understanding of working with heavily imbalanced data, such as varying the metrics for evaluating models and using resampling techniques such as ADASYN to deal with the imbalance.

## Background of the data
Since the CSV is too large to easily upload, the original data and more information can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  It was taken from an older kaggle competition and all work that I completed on my project was carried out without looking at any of the previous solutions.
